The PHYEX parameterizations can be called from different models (eg. Meso-NH, AROME) and from
a driver (which will be included in this repository).
Moreover, PHYEX parameterizations call externals subroutines, which are dependencies.

This document aims at listing the interfaces to call the PHYEX parameterizations and the
interfaces of the external modules called by PHYEX.

PHYEX interfaces:
- lima_adjust
- ice_adjust
- shallow_mf
- turb
- lima, lima_warm, lima_cold et lima_mixed
- rain_ice, rain_ice_old
- ini_...

Dependencies:
- budget
- mode_msg, modd_io
- modd_precision
- modd_cst
- yomhook, parkind1
