The testprogs_data directory must be filled by reference data.
These data are generated according to the description provided in the Offline documentation.

The check_commit_testprogs.sh script will run offline simulations in the directory given
by the environment variable TESTPROGSDIR ($HOME/TESTPROGS will be used if the variable is not set).
This directory must exist.

The goal of the script is to compare outputs between two simulations (to check if bit-reproducibilty
is achieved or not).
A reference simulation must be performed and save. This reference simulation is run the same way as the
test experiment but cannot be compared to something else:
check_commit_testprogs.sh -c -r <reference_commit>

If this reference simulation must become the 'absolute' reference (used when invoking the check_commit_testprogs.sh
script with the 'REF' argument), the reference simulation directory (under $TESTPROGSDIR) must be renamed 'ref'.
