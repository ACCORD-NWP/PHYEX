## DATA

There are two options.

On one hand, the data can be generated (please, refer to the [Offline](../docs/Offline.md) documentation) and, once produced, be put in the corresponding directories under tools/testprogs\_data.

On the other hand, a reduced dataset can be automatically dowloaded and installed using the INSTALL.sh script.
